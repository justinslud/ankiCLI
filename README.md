# ankiCLI
An anki command-line interface I use to perform various tasks such as adding cards without the GUI.

### Things you can do:
- Get info about a deck
- Add cards to a deck one at a time
- Batch add cards from a CSV file

### Example commands:
Getting deck info:
```ankicli.py -i deck1 deck2```

Adding cards to a deck one at a time:
```ankicli.py -a add -d deckname```

Add cards from CSV:
```ankicli.py -a addcsv [csvname]```
